                It looks really great, but I don't know which video we'd add!

                 <p>
                   Across STEM industries and academic institutions there are many challenges: professional isolation, sexual harassment and bullying and difficulties balancing work and family. These sorts of experiences disproportionately affect women, people from ethnic minorities, the LGBTQ+ community and disabled people.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   There are currently many projects to increase the uptake of STEM subjects by school/undergraduate students. However there are very few evidence based, large scale projects to improve the environment within these areas.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    We invite you to join like-minded people across a variety of STEM based fields to network, design and develop projects to increase diversity in STEM and improve the working environment.
